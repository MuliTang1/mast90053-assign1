Please insert your solutions and working into the corresponding existing files.
For instance: for Exercise 1, edit the file sol1.md in directory ex1 and complete the sections that are listed.
(You don't absolutely need to keep to the structure I gave, but try to if it makes sense in the context of your solution.
And don't worry about stuff being repeated in different places, e.g. in your answers in sol1.md and any additional material you provide.)
Once you're done editing sol1.md, don't forget to add your edits to the repository with something like

```
git add sol1.md
git commit -m "answers for Exercise 1"
```

Feel free to attach any additional material in the appropriate directory; for instance if you want to attach a Mathematica notebook called myex4.nb to Exercise 4, copy it into the directory ex4, add it to the repository and commit your changes with

```
git add myex4.nb
git commit -m "mathematica notebook for Exercise 4"
```

If you've written solutions in TeX, you can either break them up into the different exercises and put each into the corresponding directory, or if that's too much trouble just put the whole TeX file into the main directory of the repository.

Don't forget to add and commit all changes and push to GitHub before the deadline.
Double-check that everything is okay with

```
git status
```

If it says something like

```
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

then you are good to go.

I would recommend committing and pushing as you progress through the assignment (think of it as smart backup).
